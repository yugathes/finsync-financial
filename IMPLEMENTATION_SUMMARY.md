### 2. Enhanced Commitment System

### 3. Payment Tracking System

- **NewCommitmentForm**: Comprehensive form for creating commitments
- **CommitmentList**: Advanced list with payment status, categories, and actions
- **Enhanced Balance Card**: Blue gradient design with financial metrics

## 🗃️ Database Schema

### New Tables Created
```sql
-- Monthly income tracking
monthly_income (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  month TEXT, -- 'YYYY-MM' format
  amount DECIMAL(10,2),
  created_at, updated_at
)

-- Enhanced commitments structure  
new_commitments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  type TEXT, -- 'static' | 'dynamic'
  title TEXT,
  category TEXT,
  amount DECIMAL(10,2),
  recurring BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  shared BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  group_id UUID, -- For shared commitments
  start_date DATE,
  created_at, updated_at
)

-- Payment tracking per month
commitment_payments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  commitment_id UUID REFERENCES new_commitments(id),
  month TEXT, -- 'YYYY-MM' format
  paid_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  amount_paid DECIMAL(10,2),
  paid_at TIMESTAMP
)
```

## 🚀 User Flow Implementation

### 1. First-Time User Setup
1. User logs in → Dashboard loads
2. If no income set → Prompt to add monthly income
3. If no commitments → Show empty state with "Add First Commitment" button

### 2. Monthly Commitment Management
1. User adds commitments (static/dynamic, recurring, categories)
2. Each month, commitments appear automatically if recurring
3. User marks commitments as paid → Balance updates immediately
4. Historical view available for past months

### 3. Financial Tracking
1. Dashboard shows real-time financial overview
2. Month-by-month navigation maintains context
3. Payment status tracked independently per month
4. Available balance calculated: Income - Paid Commitments
