   User B accepts invitation
   User A shares commitment
   User B views and marks as paid
   User A sees update
   ```

   ```

3. **Filter Flow**
   ```
   User has 5 personal, 3 shared, 2 imported
   Default: Shows 5 personal
   Toggle shared: Shows 8 (personal + shared)
   Toggle imported: Shows 10 (all)
   ```

## Future Enhancements

### Realtime Updates (Optional)
Currently, users need to refresh to see updates. Could add Supabase Realtime:

```typescript
// Subscribe to group commitment changes
supabase
  .channel('group-commitments')
  .on('postgres_changes', 
    { 
      event: '*', 
      schema: 'public', 
      table: 'commitments',
      filter: `group_id=eq.${groupId}`
    },
    (payload) => {
      // Update local state
    }
  )
  .subscribe()
```

### Notifications
- Email notifications for invitations
- Push notifications for payment updates
- Weekly summaries

### Enhanced Analytics
- Group spending trends
- Category breakdown per group
- Member contribution tracking

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Invitation not showing up?**
A: Make sure the invited user exists in the system. The email must match their registered email.

**Q: Can't see shared commitments?**
A: Check that:
1. You've accepted the group invitation
2. The commitment has `shared: true`
3. The commitment has the correct `groupId`
4. You've toggled "Show Shared Commitments" in Dashboard

**Q: Import failed?**
A: Verify:
1. CSV/JSON format is correct
2. Required fields are present
3. Amount values are numeric
4. File is not corrupted

## Migration Guide

If upgrading from previous version:

1. **Database Migration**
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   npx prisma generate
   ```

2. **No Data Loss**
   - Existing commitments unaffected
   - New columns have default values
   - Backward compatible

3. **Optional Cleanup**
